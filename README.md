## Overview
 Rancid Tomatillos is a movie details and reviewing website. Users can curate a list of favorite movies to reference later and save it to their personal account. Once logged in a user can view a movies details, rate and leave feedback for specific movies. If a user hasnt seen a movie but is still curious about its quality, the movies also present an aggregated average score from all site users as well as allow non subscribers to view the comments for each individual movie.
 Developers have to create and deploy the site as well as a microservice from scratch, get dynamic routing to work appropriately according to each movie clicked, also create redirect functionality in the instance of a 400 level error.
